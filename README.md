# TodoDo
A Todo list wallpaper creator.

Stands for **Todo** **D**eskt**o**p.  
A simple script to make your Todo list as your desktop background. Simply edit the todos.txt file and run the script.  

The script randomly chooses one of the many options from the color palette which has soothing combinations of colors and, 
uses (by-default) semi-bold-italic open-sans font to make the background todo list. The script automatically aligns the text 
and is very flexible at the font's style and size, both of which can be easily changed in the settings file which is saved in
.txt format for easy access to users.
